        Leonardo Dicaprio and Oscars
        1. You have to write a code that describe Leo:
        - if oscar was (integer) 88, you have to return "Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy".
        - if oscar was 86, you have to return "Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!"
        - if it was not 88 or 86 (and below 88) you should return "When will you give Leo an Oscar?"
        - if it was over 88 you should return "Leo got one already!" */

      let a = +prompt("Enter the 86, 88, либо число ниже 86");

      if (a == 88) {
        alert("Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy");
      } else if (a == 86) {
        alert("Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?");
      } else if (a !== 86 || a !== 88 || a < 87) {
        alert("When will you give Leo an Oscar?");
      } else if (a > 89) {
        alert("Leo got one already!");
      }

      //   switch (a) {
      //     case 88:
      //       alert("Leo finally won the oscar! Leo is happy");
      //       break;
      //     case 86:
      //       alert("Not even for Wolf of wallstreet?!");
      //       break;
      //   }
